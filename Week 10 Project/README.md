TODO

- A set-up similar to Week 9's 'Finance' Problem Set. Using HTML (with Jinja templating), CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript (for any in-app dynamics), Python (with Flask for routing and database CRUD operations), SQLite3 for the database.

- This will be an application to help children to learn to type and to spell, and to learn some basic reading comprehension, and to learn some basic maths (and, perhaps, some other things, but we'll see when we run out of time!).

- This README needs to be several hundred words
