Question 1.
If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

If we run this command "SELECT AVG(valence), AVG(danceability), AVG(energy) FROM songs;" we get the following result:
+--------------+-------------------+-------------+
| AVG(valence) | AVG(danceability) | AVG(energy) |
+--------------+-------------------+-------------+
| 0.484443     | 0.71646           | 0.65906     |
+--------------+-------------------+-------------+
Well, I'm not quite sure. A valence of 0.48 seems a little sad/downbeat.
However, a danceability score of 0.72 seems more optimistic.
Likewise, the 'energy' average of 0.66 doesn't quite match the valence.
As such, I feel that I would have to describe this playlist as sad dance music.

Question 2.
Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

Well, the information utilised above to make a determination about the listener's 'aura' didn't take into consideration
the other aspects of the songs in the list such as their 'loudness', 'speechiness', 'tempo', duration, or factors beyond
the scope of the data such as relative number of repeat listens, or whether the music was listened to ironically.
I would propose taking into consideration a broader range of factors.
