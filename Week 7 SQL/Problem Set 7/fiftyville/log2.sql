-- "Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get into a car in the bakery parking lot and drive away.
-- If you have security footage from the bakery parking lot, you might want to look for cars that left the parking lot in that time frame."
-- So, we can look at the bakery security logs to see which license plates left at that time...

-- We can use the list of possible thieves (and their plate numbers) we obtained before using the phone-call data and cross-reference this with the number plates of the cars that left the parking lot at that time.
